# Project-manager
a taskboard/project manager created using fullstack MERN. Using CRUD commands, it allows user to enter new task and also keep track of old tasks that are in progress or completed until removed completely from database.

Demonstrates the use of API calls to our own API to retrieve user data from our MongoDB and display it on the front end.
